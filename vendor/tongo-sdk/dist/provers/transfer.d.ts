 * Verifies the transfer operation. First, users have to show knowledge of the private key. Then, users have to provide
 * two cipher balances, one (L,R) is an encryption of the transfer amount b under its public key, the other (L_bar, R_bar)
 * an encryption of the transfer amount b under the receiver public key. Users have to provide a ZK proof that both encryptions
 * are indeed encrypting the same amount for the correct public keys. To show the transfer amount b is positive,
 * when the first RangeProof is verified, it returns a V1 = g**b h**r1, with b positive. V1 is used as an L part
 * of a cipher balance, users have to prove that the cipher balance (V1, R_aux1 = g**r1) is encrypting the same
 * amount that (L,R). The cipher balance after the operation would be (L0,R0) = (CL/L, CR/R) where (CL,CR) is the
 * current balance. To show that (L0, R0) is encrypting an amount b_left positive, when the second RangeProof is
 * verified, it returns a V2 = g**b_left h**r2, with b_left positive. V2 is used as an L part
 * of a cipher balance, users have to prove that the cipher balance (V2, R_aux2 = g**r2) is encrypting the same
 * amount that (L0,R0)
 *
 * Complexity:
 * - EC_MUL: 27 + 2*n*5  = 347 for u32
 * - EC_ADD: 18  + 2*n*4 = 274 for u32
 *
 * @param {InputsTransfer} inputs - The transfer operation inputs
 * @param {ProofOfTransfer} proof - The proof to verify
 * @returns {boolean} True if the proof is valid, false otherwise
