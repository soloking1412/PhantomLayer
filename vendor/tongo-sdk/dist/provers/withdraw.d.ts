/**
 * Verifies the withdraw operation. First, users have to show knowledge of the private key. Then, users have to provide
 * a cleartext of the amount b to withdraw. The contract will construct a cipher balance (L2, R2) = (g**b y**r2, g**r2)
 * with randomness r2='withdraw'. The contract will subtract (L2,R2) to the stored balance of the user. The user have
 * to provide a zk proof that the final cipher balance is encrypting a positive (a value in (0, u**32)) amount b_left. To do
 * this when the RangeProof is verified, it returns a V = g**b_left h**r, with b_left positive. V is used as an L part of
 * a cipher balance, users have to prove that the cipher balance (V, R_aux = g**r) is encrypting the same amount
 * that the final cipher balance.

 * - EC_MUL: 12 + n*5 = 172 for u32
